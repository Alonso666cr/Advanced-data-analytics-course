> delitos_data <- delitos_data[delitos_data$dpto_ccdgo == c ('05'), ] > dim(delitos_data) [1] 49610    91
```

In this line the 05 code represents the Antioquia department from the Dane data base codes. The line dim(delitos_data) give us a result about how big is our data base, the distribution in rows (49610) and columns (91).

```         
> summary(delitos_data)
```

This code show us the different kind of crimes, misdemeanors, offenses or infractions in a period of time. For example, for this exercises we choose 24HP that means "hurto a personas en 2024":

Prompt: What is the meaning of the values from sum_24HP that represents the sum of robberies to people in 2024 (where "24" stands for the year).

The values from **`sum_24HP`** represent the **sum of robberies to people in 2024**, where:

-   **Min (0.0000)** â†’ Some areas or time periods had **zero reported robberies**.

-   **1st Quartile (0.0000)**â†’ At least **25% of the observations** had zero robberies.

-   **Median (0.0000)** â†’ At least **50% (half) of the observations had zero robberies**.

-   **Mean (0.3982)** â†’ The average number of robberies per unit of observation is **less than 0.4**, meaning that while most places/times had zero, some had a high number of incidents.

-   **3rd Quartile (0.0000)** â†’ **75% of the data points had zero robberies**, emphasizing a high concentration of locations/times with no incidents.

-   **Max (699.0000)** â†’ There was at least **one location/time period where up to 699 robberies occurred**.

### Interpretation

-   **Highly skewed distribution**: Most areas/times had no robberies, but some had extremely high numbers.

-   **Presence of robbery hotspots**: A few locations or time frames had significantly more incidents.

-   **Possible data issues**: The extreme maximum suggests either a real **crime surge in some areas** or **possible data entry errors**.

```         
> # quantile > quantile(delitos_data$sum_24HP, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.1), na.rm = TRUE)   0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90% 100%     0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1  699 
```

In quantiles, we can observe that up to 80% of the records have a value of 0, meaning that no robberies were recorded. At the 90th percentile, the value of 1 indicates that only 10% of the observations have a value greater than 1. The maximum value, at the 100th percentile, is 699, which can be interpreted as at least one area having a significantly higher concentration of robberies compared to the majority of the data.

In the boxplot, we can observe that the distribution of the variables is asymmetric, confirming that the vast majority of the data has values close to zero. Additionally, the presence of scattered outliers on the right is clearly visible.

## Skewness

```         
> paste0('sum_24HP: ', skewness) [1] "sum_24HP: 108.920265681" >  > # function > skewness(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 108.917
```

A skewness of 0 or close to 0 indicates a symmetric distribution. If it is greater than 1, the skew is to the right, and if it is negative, the skew is to the left. Consequently, in our data, the skewness value of 108.92 represents extreme asymmetry, providing further evidence of the inequality in the distribution of our data.

## Kurtosis

![](images/clipboard-857239839.png)

Image take from: <https://brandata.com.mx/2023/06/09/la-curtosis-que-es/>

```         
> # function > kurtosis(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 17488.53
```

The kurtosis calculation yields a value of 17488.53, which is exceptionally high. This suggests a distribution with most values concentrated near the mean while also exhibiting a substantial number of extreme values (outliers). In other words, the distribution has heavy tails, making it highly leptokurtic.

## Coefficient of Variation

```         
> mean_val <- mean(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE)  > print(mean_val)  [1] 0.3981858 > std_dev <- sd(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE) > print(std_dev) [1] 4.084402 > lower_bound <- mean_val - std_dev > upper_bound <- mean_val + std_dev > paste0('lower_bound: ', round(lower_bound, 2), ' - upper_bound: ', round(upper_bound, 2)) [1] "lower_bound: -3.69 - upper_bound: 4.48" > percentage_1sd <- (within_1sd / nrow(delitos_data)) * 100 > paste0('within_1sd: ', round(within_1sd, 2), ' - percentage_1sd: ', round(percentage_1sd, 2)) [1] "within_1sd: 48877 - percentage_1sd: 98.52" > paste0('cv: ', round(std_dev / mean_val * 100), 2) [1] "cv: 10262"
```

Since the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to compare the variability of datasets with different units or widely differing means, and a lower CV indicates less variability relative to the mean, we observe that a CV of 10.262% suggests high variability.

Regarding the mean, which is a measure of central tendency (meaning its calculated value represents the center of the dataset) a result of 0.398 suggests that most areas have few or no recorded events. This implies that the mean may be influenced by a few high values, making it an unreliable representation of the central tendency.

Additionally, the standard deviation, which measures the dispersion of the data relative to the mean, is 4.084 in this case. This indicates that values can vary by approximately Â±4.084 from the mean of 0.398, further confirming the high variability in the dataset.

Finally, the ranges within the standard deviation variation (1SD) are calculated using the lower limit as the mean minus the standard deviation and the upper limit as the mean plus the standard deviation. The ranges within the 1SD variation, with a lower limit of -3.69 and an upper limit of 4.48, indicate that the events are highly skewed. This is because most values fall between 0 and 4 (with negative numbers being adjusted to 0). In this dataset, negative values are not possible. If negative values appear, it suggests that the data distribution is highly asymmetric.

Prompt: What is the meaning of having percentages of values within 1SD of "within_1sd: 48877 - percentage_1sd: 98.52"? Explain in a concise paragraph both numbers.

The result **"within_1sd: 48,877 - percentage_1sd: 98.52"** indicates that **48,877 observations (98.52% of the dataset)** fall within one standard deviation (Â±1SD) of the mean. In a **normally distributed dataset**, approximately **68%** of values should fall within this range. However, in this case, nearly **99% of the values** are concentrated within this narrow range, suggesting that the dataset is **highly skewed** with most values being very close to the mean and a few extreme outliers inflating the standard deviation. This confirms that **the standard deviation is not a reliable measure of spread for these data**, and alternative measures such as percentiles or transformations should be considered.

## Median Absolute Deviation MAD and MAD/median

```         
> median_val <- median(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE)  > print(median_val)  [1] 0 > mad_val <- mad(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE)  # Compute MAD > print(mad_val) [1] 0 > lower_bound <- median_val - mad_val > upper_bound <- median_val + mad_val > paste0('lower_bound: ', round(lower_bound, 2), ' - upper_bound: ', round(upper_bound, 2)) [1] "lower_bound: 0 - upper_bound: 0" > within_1mad <- sum(delitos_data$sum_24HP >= lower_bound & delitos_data$sum_24HP <= upper_bound, na.rm = TRUE) > percentage_1mad <- (within_1mad / nrow(delitos_data)) * 100 > paste0('within_1mad: ', round(within_1mad, 2), ' - percentage_1mad: ', round(percentage_1mad, 2)) [1] "within_1mad: 42388 - percentage_1mad: 85.44" > # MAD/Median > paste0('MAD/Median: ', round(mad_val / median_val * 100), 2) [1] "MAD/Median: NaN2"
```

Prompt: What is the interpretation of this results? Explain it.

### **Interpretation of the Results**

These results confirm that the dataset **is highly concentrated around zero**, with minimal variability for most observations and a small number of extreme outliers. Letâ€™s analyze each statistic in detail:

### **1. Median (**`median_val`**)**

ðŸ“Œ **Value obtained:** `0`\
ðŸ“Œ **Interpretation:**

-   The **median is 0**, meaning that at least **50% of the dataset consists of zero values**.

-   This suggests that in at least half of the areas analyzed, **no incidents were recorded in 2024**.

-   The fact that the median is **so low compared to the mean (0.398 from previous analysis)** confirms that **a small number of extremely high values (outliers) are inflating the mean**.

### **2. Median Absolute Deviation (**`MAD`**)**

ðŸ“Œ **Value obtained:** `0`\
ðŸ“Œ **Interpretation:**

-   The **MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) measures dispersion around the median**.

-   Since **MAD = 0**, this means that **the majority of values are exactly equal to the median (0)**.

-   In other words, **most of the dataset consists of zeros, with very few nonzero values**.

-   **MAD fails to capture variability** because the majority of the data points have the same value.

### **3. Range within** `1MAD`

ðŸ“Œ **Lower and Upper Bound:** `"lower_bound: 0 - upper_bound: 0"`\
ðŸ“Œ **Interpretation:**

-   The **range defined by 1 MAD** only includes the value **0**, meaning that **all values inside this range are zeros**.

-   This further confirms that the dataset **has little dispersion for most observations, except for a few extreme values**.

### **4. Percentage of Values within** `1MAD`

ðŸ“Œ **Value obtained:** `"within_1mad: 42,388 - percentage_1mad: 85.44%"`\
ðŸ“Œ **Interpretation:**

-   **85.44% of observations are exactly 0**.

-   This means that only **14.56% of the dataset contains any nonzero values**.

-   The data is **highly "zero-inflated"**, meaning that most areas **did not record any incidents in 2024**, while only a few areas had significant crime counts.

### **5.** `MAD / Median` **Ratio**

ðŸ“Œ **Value obtained:** `"MAD/Median: NaN2"`\
ðŸ“Œ **Interpretation:**

-   This calculation **fails (`NaN`) because the denominator is `0`** (since the median is 0).

-   This confirms that **MAD/Median cannot be used as a measure of relative dispersion in this dataset**.

-   The presence of so many zeros makes **traditional measures of dispersion ineffective**, and alternative methods should be used.

## **Conclusion**

In 85.44% of Antioquia, no personal thefts were recorded, indicating that thefts are concentrated in specific areas of the department. This highlights the need for intervention strategies and measures not only from law enforcement but also through active citizen participation. The state should implement prevention and control activities in collaboration with the community.
