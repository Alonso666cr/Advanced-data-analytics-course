```         
> delitos_data <- delitos_data[delitos_data$dpto_ccdgo == c ('05'), ] > dim(delitos_data) [1] 49610    91
```

In this line the 05 code represents the Antioquia department from the Dane data base codes. The line dim(delitos_data) give us a result about how big is our data base, the distribution in rows (49610) and columns (91).

```         
> summary(delitos_data)
```

This code show us the different kind of crimes, misdemeanors, offenses or infractions in a period of time. For example, for this exercises we choose 24HP that means "hurto a personas en 2024":

![](images/clipboard-2144231668.png)

Prompt: What is the meaning of the values from sum_24HP that represents the sum of robberies to people in 2024 (where "24" stands for the year).

The values from **`sum_24HP`** represent the **sum of robberies to people in 2024**, where:

-   **Min (0.0000)** â†’ Some areas or time periods had **zero reported robberies**.

-   **1st Quartile (0.0000)**â†’ At least **25% of the observations** had zero robberies.

-   **Median (0.0000)** â†’ At least **50% (half) of the observations had zero robberies**.

-   **Mean (0.3982)** â†’ The average number of robberies per unit of observation is **less than 0.4**, meaning that while most places/times had zero, some had a high number of incidents.

-   **3rd Quartile (0.0000)** â†’ **75% of the data points had zero robberies**, emphasizing a high concentration of locations/times with no incidents.

-   **Max (699.0000)** â†’ There was at least **one location/time period where up to 699 robberies occurred**.

### Interpretation

-   **Highly skewed distribution**: Most areas/times had no robberies, but some had extremely high numbers.

-   **Presence of robbery hotspots**: A few locations or time frames had significantly more incidents.

-   **Possible data issues**: The extreme maximum suggests either a real **crime surge in some areas** or **possible data entry errors**.

```         
> # quantile > quantile(delitos_data$sum_24HP, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.1), na.rm = TRUE)   0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90% 100%     0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1  699 
```

In quantiles, we can observe that up to 80% of the records have a value of 0, meaning that no robberies were recorded. At the 90th percentile, the value of 1 indicates that only 10% of the observations have a value greater than 1. The maximum value, at the 100th percentile, is 699, which can be interpreted as at least one area having a significantly higher concentration of robberies compared to the majority of the data.

![](images/clipboard-3158233108.png)

In the boxplot, we can observe that the distribution of the variables is asymmetric, confirming that the vast majority of the data has values close to zero. Additionally, the presence of scattered outliers on the right is clearly visible.

## Skewness

```         
> paste0('sum_24HP: ', skewness) [1] "sum_24HP: 108.920265681" >  > # function > skewness(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 108.917
```

A skewness of 0 or close to 0 indicates a symmetric distribution. If it is greater than 1, the skew is to the right, and if it is negative, the skew is to the left. Consequently, in our data, the skewness value of 108.92 represents extreme asymmetry, providing further evidence of the inequality in the distribution of our data.

## Kurtosis

![](images/clipboard-857239839.png)

Image take from: <https://brandata.com.mx/2023/06/09/la-curtosis-que-es/>

```         
> # function > kurtosis(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 17488.53
```

The kurtosis calculation yields a value of 17488.53, which is exceptionally high. This suggests a distribution with most values concentrated near the mean while also exhibiting a substantial number of extreme values (outliers). In other words, the distribution has heavy tails, making it highly leptokurtic.

## Coefficient of Variation

```         
> mean_val <- mean(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE)  > print(mean_val)  [1] 0.3981858 > std_dev <- sd(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE) > print(std_dev) [1] 4.084402 > lower_bound <- mean_val - std_dev > upper_bound <- mean_val + std_dev > paste0('lower_bound: ', round(lower_bound, 2), ' - upper_bound: ', round(upper_bound, 2)) [1] "lower_bound: -3.69 - upper_bound: 4.48" > percentage_1sd <- (within_1sd / nrow(delitos_data)) * 100 > paste0('within_1sd: ', round(within_1sd, 2), ' - percentage_1sd: ', round(percentage_1sd, 2)) [1] "within_1sd: 48877 - percentage_1sd: 98.52" > paste0('cv: ', round(std_dev / mean_val * 100), 2) [1] "cv: 10262"
```

Since the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to compare the variability of datasets with different units or widely differing means, and a lower CV indicates less variability relative to the mean, we observe that a CV of 10.262% suggests high variability.

Regarding the mean, which is a measure of central tendency (meaning its calculated value represents the center of the dataset) a result of 0.398 suggests that most areas have few or no recorded events. This implies that the mean may be influenced by a few high values, making it an unreliable representation of the central tendency.

Additionally, the standard deviation, which measures the dispersion of the data relative to the mean, is 4.084 in this case. This indicates that values can vary by approximately Â±4.084 from the mean of 0.398, further confirming the high variability in the dataset.

Finally, the ranges within the standard deviation variation (1SD) are calculated using the lower limit as the mean minus the standard deviation and the upper limit as the mean plus the standard deviation. The ranges within the 1SD variation, with a lower limit of -3.69 and an upper limit of 4.48, indicate that the events are highly skewed. This is because most values fall between 0 and 4 (with negative numbers being adjusted to 0). In this dataset, negative values are not possible. If negative values appear, it suggests that the data distribution is highly asymmetric.

Prompt: What is the meaning of having percentages of values within 1SD of "within_1sd: 48877 - percentage_1sd: 98.52"? Explain in a concise paragraph both numbers.

The result **"within_1sd: 48,877 - percentage_1sd: 98.52"** indicates that **48,877 observations (98.52% of the dataset)** fall within one standard deviation (Â±1SD) of the mean. In a **normally distributed dataset**, approximately **68%** of values should fall within this range. However, in this case, nearly **99% of the values** are concentrated within this narrow range, suggesting that the dataset is **highly skewed** with most values being very close to the mean and a few extreme outliers inflating the standard deviation. This confirms that **the standard deviation is not a reliable measure of spread for these data**, and alternative measures such as percentiles or transformations should be considered.

## Median Absolute Deviation MAD and MAD/median

```         
> median_val <- median(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE)  > print(median_val)  [1] 0 > mad_val <- mad(delitos_data$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE)  # Compute MAD > print(mad_val) [1] 0 > lower_bound <- median_val - mad_val > upper_bound <- median_val + mad_val > paste0('lower_bound: ', round(lower_bound, 2), ' - upper_bound: ', round(upper_bound, 2)) [1] "lower_bound: 0 - upper_bound: 0" > within_1mad <- sum(delitos_data$sum_24HP >= lower_bound & delitos_data$sum_24HP <= upper_bound, na.rm = TRUE) > percentage_1mad <- (within_1mad / nrow(delitos_data)) * 100 > paste0('within_1mad: ', round(within_1mad, 2), ' - percentage_1mad: ', round(percentage_1mad, 2)) [1] "within_1mad: 42388 - percentage_1mad: 85.44" > # MAD/Median > paste0('MAD/Median: ', round(mad_val / median_val * 100), 2) [1] "MAD/Median: NaN2"
```

Prompt: What is the interpretation of this results? Explain it.

### **Interpretation of the Results**

These results confirm that the dataset **is highly concentrated around zero**, with minimal variability for most observations and a small number of extreme outliers. Letâ€™s analyze each statistic in detail:

### **1. Median (**`median_val`**)**

ðŸ“Œ **Value obtained:** `0`\
ðŸ“Œ **Interpretation:**

-   The **median is 0**, meaning that at least **50% of the dataset consists of zero values**.

-   This suggests that in at least half of the areas analyzed, **no incidents were recorded in 2024**.

-   The fact that the median is **so low compared to the mean (0.398 from previous analysis)** confirms that **a small number of extremely high values (outliers) are inflating the mean**.

### **2. Median Absolute Deviation (**`MAD`**)**

ðŸ“Œ **Value obtained:** `0`\
ðŸ“Œ **Interpretation:**

-   The **MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) measures dispersion around the median**.

-   Since **MAD = 0**, this means that **the majority of values are exactly equal to the median (0)**.

-   In other words, **most of the dataset consists of zeros, with very few nonzero values**.

-   **MAD fails to capture variability** because the majority of the data points have the same value.

### **3. Range within** `1MAD`

ðŸ“Œ **Lower and Upper Bound:** `"lower_bound: 0 - upper_bound: 0"`\
ðŸ“Œ **Interpretation:**

-   The **range defined by 1 MAD** only includes the value **0**, meaning that **all values inside this range are zeros**.

-   This further confirms that the dataset **has little dispersion for most observations, except for a few extreme values**.

### **4. Percentage of Values within** `1MAD`

ðŸ“Œ **Value obtained:** `"within_1mad: 42,388 - percentage_1mad: 85.44%"`\
ðŸ“Œ **Interpretation:**

-   **85.44% of observations are exactly 0**.

-   This means that only **14.56% of the dataset contains any nonzero values**.

-   The data is **highly "zero-inflated"**, meaning that most areas **did not record any incidents in 2024**, while only a few areas had significant crime counts.

### **5.** `MAD / Median` **Ratio**

ðŸ“Œ **Value obtained:** `"MAD/Median: NaN2"`\
ðŸ“Œ **Interpretation:**

-   This calculation **fails (`NaN`) because the denominator is `0`** (since the median is 0).

-   This confirms that **MAD/Median cannot be used as a measure of relative dispersion in this dataset**.

-   The presence of so many zeros makes **traditional measures of dispersion ineffective**, and alternative methods should be used.

## **Conclusion**

In 85.44% of Antioquia, no personal thefts were recorded, indicating that thefts are concentrated in specific areas of the department. This highlights the need for intervention strategies and measures not only from law enforcement but also through active citizen participation. The state should implement prevention and control activities in collaboration with the community.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Course:** Advance Analytics of Data.

**Student:** AndrÃ©s Cervantes Torres.

**Professor**: AndrÃ©s PÃ©rez-Coronado.

Note: for my analysis I've chosen region \[88\] =\> (**archipiÃ©lago de san andrÃ©s providencia y santa catalina**).

-\> delitos_data \<- delitos_data\[delitos_data\$dpto_ccdgo == c ('88'), \]

Is this line the 88 code represent San Andres y Providencia from DANE data base standared codes.

-\> dim(delitos_data)

It is saying the dimension about specific data for the region select previously. In this case 883 rows and 91 colums.

-\> summary(delitos_data)

This line permits to know measurements about different kind of crymes against population specifically in region 88. For instance, we can see one of them called "24HP", whos meaning is theft from persons. This summary shows measures of central tendency: Min: 0, 1st Qu.:0, Median: 0, Mean: 0, 3rd Qu.: 0, Max: 0.

-\> quantile(delitos_data\$sum_24HP, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.1), na.rm = TRUE)

Prompt: Chat, What does the R "quantile" function tell me, applying the following parameters: \# quantile quantile(delitos_data\$sum_24HP, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.1), na.rm = TRUE)?

OpenAI GPT-4o

The quantile() function in R is used to calculate the quartiles, quintiles, deciles, or any other percentile of a dataset. In your case, by applying quantile(delitos_data\$sum_24HP, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.1), na.rm = TRUE), you are asking to find the deciles of the sum_24HP column of the crÃ­menes_data dataframe.

Here we have results for region 88 (San AndrÃ©s y Providencia):

0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 12

This quantile result says we have concentrated major amount of crimes concentrated in some specific municipalities. 92.30% of crimes have been located in 20% of territory.

-\> write.csv(delitos_data, file = "delitos_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

I've applied this line to export "delitos_data" dataset to Excel.

-\> boxplot(delitos_data\$sum_24HP, main = "Boxplot of PERSONAS", horizontal = TRUE)

This boxplot represents the distribution of values â€‹â€‹in sum_24HP, showing the median, quartiles, and any outliers in the distribution.

![](images/clipboard-3840180970.png)

## -\> **Skewness**

Applying skewness to 24HP with value equal to 7.002492, we can say it is extremely high and suggests a strong positive skewness in the distribution of your data.

Prompt: Chat, aÃºn sabiendo que, mean_x = 0.2536806, Â¿consideras que un skewness de 7.002492 es muy alto?

A skewness value greater than 1 (or even 2) usually indicates that the distribution is skewed to the right. In your case, a skewness of 7.002492 indicates that most of your values â€‹â€‹are low (as suggested by a mean of 0.2536806), but there are some very high values â€‹â€‹(outliers) that are affecting the mean and causing the distribution to be unbalanced.

![](images/clipboard-1566564623.png)

## -\> **Kurtosis**

In this case applying \[kurtosis(delitos_data\$sum_24HP, na.rm = TRUE)\] we get 65.45428 as result.

Taking this result into account and we knowing that:

A kurtosis of $( 0 )$ (excess kurtosis) indicates tail behavior similar to a normal distribution. Positive kurtosis $( g_2 > 0 )$ signifies heavier tails and more outliers (leptokurtic), while negative kurtosis $( g_2 < 0 )$ indicates lighter tails and fewer outliers (platykurtic).

![](images/clipboard-3989889599.png){width="311"}

We can define this Kurtosis as Leptokurtic for 24HP variable since it means we have more outliers.

## -\> **Coefficient of Variation**

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) is a statistical measure that indicates the relative dispersion of data in relation to the mean. It is expressed as a percentage and is used to compare variability between different datasets or measurements.

Performing the calculations in R, I obtained the mean and standard deviation (0.253680634 and 0.969591831), respectively. For this exercise, the instructor suggested using a CV calculated as a percentage. If I apply the formula: round(std_dev / mean_val \* 100) The result is 3822%. I wasn't sure how R performed these calculations, so I transferred the data frame to Microsoft Excel to analyze some aspects.

![](images/clipboard-1333209121.png)

Now I know that R takes all the values, applies an AVERAGE (arithmetic average), and returns the result. I also know that the standard deviation R calculates uses the formula that applies to a sample (xÌ…), not to the population (Î¼).

Chat, I'm doing some Advanced Statistical Analysis with R. If the data set I'm analyzing gives me the following result: mean: 0.2536806 standard deviation: 0.9695918 And if with this, the Coefficient of Variation gives me: 3822%. What can I determine from that result? What conclusion can I draw?

OpenAI GPT-4o - start of comment

The **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** is a measure of the relative dispersion of data relative to its mean and is expressed as a percentage. In your case, you have the following results:

-   **Mean**: 0.2536806
-   **Standard Deviation**: 0.9695918
-   **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: 3822%

### Interpretation of the Coefficient of Variation

1.  **Highly Dispersed**:

-   A CV of **3822%** suggests that there is a large variability in your data compared to the mean. This means that, on average, the standard deviation is more than 38 times greater than the mean.

2.  **Mean**:

-   Most of your data can vary significantly and could include numerous extreme values â€‹â€‹or outliers.
-   Since the mean is relatively low, it suggests that the data is very inconsistent or that there are many zeros in the data set.

### Conclusions

1.  **Data Instability**:

-   High variability indicates that the data is not stable, and it may be difficult to make accurate predictions based on the mean.

2.  **Attitude Toward Analysis**:

-   You might consider exploring the data further, looking for outliers, distributions, and other descriptive statistics that can help you understand the behavior of your data.

3.  **Further Analysis**:

-   You could use visualizations (such as histograms or boxplots) to better understand the distribution and variability of the data.

Such a high CV is often an indication that further analysis is needed to provide meaningful insights. If you need more information on how to proceed or perform other types of analysis, let me know!

OpenAI GPT-4o - end of comment

Well, as mentioned in the ChatGPT analysis, within the 24HP (Personal Theft) dataset, we definitely have a large number of zeros. This is because we begin to find cases starting at 90% of the data.

![](images/clipboard-3508930267.png)

Now, if we compare the CVs of the different crimes, we can say that there is considerable variability in the occurrence of SUM_24HP (3.82) compared to its mean (0.2536806). We also note that there are other crimes with much higher CVs. Therefore, a CV of 3.82 for SUM_24HP suggests that this illegal act is less predictable and could be affected by external factors or changing conditions in the region.
